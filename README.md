# Covid Vaccine Availability Dashboard

The purpose of this project is to quickly view vaccine availability by district or PIN code. Checking it with [Cowin app](cowin.gov.in) by the government of India can be time taking and cumbersome due to frequent timeouts.


Note: Use this app to view vaccine availability. The actual booking needs to be done by the [Cowin app](cowin.gov.in)
